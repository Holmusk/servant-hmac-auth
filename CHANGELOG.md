The change log is available [on GitHub][2].

## 0.1.5 - Jan 27, 2023
* Bump dependency upper bounds, allow building with `GHC 9.0`, `9.2` and `9.4`

## 0.1.4 - March 8, 2022

* [#55](https://github.com/Holmusk/servant-hmac-auth/pull/55):
  **Breaking change:** non-standard http(s) port are now included in the HMAC signature.
